title: "The feasibility, accuracy and reliability of fully automatic analyses of left ventricular systolic longitudinal function by pocket-size imaging device"

excerpt: 'Mitral annular systolic plane excursion (MAPSE) is an easy and reliable measure of global longitudinal left ventricular (LV) function. We have developed an algorithm that automatically measures MAPSE from live grey scale recordings that can be implemented on pocket-size imaging devices (PSID). Automatic measurements and interpretations of findings can assist inexperienced users when evaluating LV function. This has never been evaluated on PSID, which so far have not been able to provide quantitative assessment of LV function.'
