excerpt: "Ultrasound imaging is a highly valuable diagnostic tool. It is increasingly portable, provides real-time imaging of complex structures, and is considered safe. Yet, because ultrasound is a highly operator dependent modality the uptake of ultrasound within a broader range of medical contexts has been limited and hasn't made major inroads within the offices of General Practitioners, Midwives, and other non-specialists. Learning to effectively use ultrasound can easily take up to 12 months with direct expert supervision."
